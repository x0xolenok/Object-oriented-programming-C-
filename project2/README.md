# Practice 2
Developing a class to perform actions on matrices

# Tasks:
- The matrices can be any type of data that you want. 
- There are not many mathematical operations on matrices, which you will define by your case, usually involving addition and multiplication of matrices.
- All further work is based on this task. 
### The second job implements the business logic, and the rest is just the interface.
- Your task is to write a class of mathematical calculations that will connect to various interfaces implemented on the .NET platform. 
- Moreover, to implement user interfaces, you also need to write classes that will implement them.
